# Improvised-banking-system 
  
this is a basic project where we aim to provide a better net banking system which is much more secure, helpful and enviornment friendly, as we aim to reduce the usage of credit/debit cards and make eventually make our society cardless(plastic-free).

It is secure as firstly the user is logged into the system using his username and password, and an otp, next whenever he/she tries to make a transaction firstly he is sent a mail and otp for 2-step verification to stop forgeries and scams.
